## Quick start

1. Download eva

    - https://github.com/ylsdamxssjxxdd/eva/releases

    - download programs with the .exe suffix for Windows or .AppImage suffix for Linux

    ```txt
        The cpu version for the best compatibility; The cuda version uses an NVIDIA graphics card for acceleration and requires cuda to be installed on the computer; The Vulkan version uses any graphics card for acceleration and requires the computer to have a graphics card installed
        
        Under Linux, this command needs to be entered in the terminal to grant EVA permission to run: chmod 777 ***** AppImage 
        It's better to .AppImage is placed in a stable pure English path and only needs to be run once .AppImage will automatically configure desktop shortcuts and start menu
    ```

2. Download gguf model

    - https://huggingface.com , eva supports almost all open-source llms

3. LoadÔºÅ

    - Click the load button, select a gguf model to load into memory

4. SendÔºÅ

    - Enter the chat content in the input area and click send

5. Accelerate!

    - Click Settings to set gpu offload. Recommended setting to maximum, but if the VRAM occupies more than 95%, it will be too laggy

    - If running SD simultaneously, make sure to leave enough VRAM for SD


## Function

### Foundation function

<details>

<summary> Two mode </summary>

1. Local mode: you left clicks the load button to interact by loading the local model

2. Link mode: you right clicks the load button and inputs the API endpoint of a certain model service for interaction (Currently supports openai type compatible interfaces)

</details>

<details>

<summary> Three state </summary>

1. Chat state

    - The default state, where chat content is entered in the input area and the model responds

    - You can set prompt templatee in date button

    - You can mount tools for the model, but they may affect the model's intelligence

    - You can take a screenshot by pressing f1 and record speech by pressing f2. The screenshot and recording will be sent to the multimodal or whisper for corresponding processing

2. Completion state

    - Typing any text in the output area and the model completing it

3. Service state

    - eva becomes an open API port service and can also chat on web pages

</details>

<details>

<summary> Six tool </summary>

In local mode and chat state, you can click on the date button to mount the tool

```txt
    The principle is to add an additional instruction in the system instruction to guide the model to call the corresponding tool
    After each model prediction is completed, eva will automatically detects whether it contains the XML field of the calling tool. If it does, the corresponding tool is called. After the tool is executed, the result is sent to the model for further prediction
```

### Enhancements

<details>

<summary> Visual </summary>

- Introduction: In Local Mode + Conversation State, you can mount visual models. Visual models typically have "mmproj" in their name and are usually compatible with specific models. Once successfully mounted, users can select an image for pre-decoding, which will serve as the context for the model.

- Activation: Right-click on the "load mmproj" input box in the settings and select the mmproj model. You can pre-decode an image by dragging it into the input box, right-clicking the input box to click, or pressing F1 to take a screenshot. Then, click the send button to pre-decode the image, and after decoding, you can proceed with the Q&A.

</details>

<details>

<summary> Auditory </summary>

- Introduction: With the help of the whisper.cpp project, the user's speech can be converted to text.You can also directly input audio and convert it into subtitle files

- Activation: Right-click the status area to open the expansion window, select the speech2text tab, and choose the path where the whisper model is located. Return to the main interface, press the F2 shortcut to start recording, press F2 again to end the recording, and it will automatically convert to text and fill into the input area.

## Concepts

<details>

<summary> expand </summary>

- model: Composed of a formula and a set of parameters

- token: The number of words, for example, hello token=123, my token=14, his token=3249, different model numbers are different

- vocab: The tokens for all words set during the training of this model are different for different model word lists

- kv cache: The keys and values of the previously calculated model's attention mechanism are equivalent to the model's memory

- decoding: The model calculates a vector table based on the context cache and the incoming new token, and obtains a new context cache

- sampling: Calculate the probability table based on the vector table and select the next word

- predict: (Decoding + Sampling) Loop

- predecode: Decode only without sampling, used to cache context such as system instructions

---

- n_ctx_train: The maximum number of tokens that can be decoded during model training

- n_ctx: The maximum number of tokens that the model can accept during decoding set by the you cannot exceed n_ctx_train, which is equivalent to memory capacity

- temperature: During sampling, the vector table will be converted into a probability table based on the temperature value, and the higher the temperature, the greater the randomness

- vecb: The probability distribution of all tokens in the word list during this decoding

- prob: The final selection probability of all tokens in the vocabulary in this sampling

- ~~Adapt to Linux (completed)~~

- ~~English version (completed)~~

## Bugs

<details>

<summary> expand </summary>

- There is a memory leak in the model inference, located in the sampling part of xbot.cpp, which is also related to qt's qplaintextedit and needs to be fixed

- In link mode, it is not possible to send continuously without intervals. It is alleviated by triggering after a timed 100ms. The QNetworkAccess Manager located in xnet.cpp cannot be released in a timely manner and needs to be fixed
-Multimodal model output abnormality, needs to be aligned with llava.cpp, to be fixed

---

- Truncate once after reaching the maximum context length and then reach it again. Decoding will fail and can be alleviated by temporarily placing empty memory. The llama_decode located in xbot.cpp returns 1 (unable to find the kv slot), which has not been fixed (in fact, after truncation, the number of tokens sent and the reserved part still exceed the maximum context length, and needs to be truncated again)

- Some UTF-8 characters have parsing issues and have been fixed (incomplete UTF-8 characters in model output need to be manually concatenated into one)

- Memory leakage during model switching, fixed (not using MMP when using CUDA)

- The version compiled by Mingw cannot recognize the Chinese path during loading, and is located in the fp=std:: fopen (fname, mode); of llama.cpp;, Fixed (using QTextCodec:: codecForName ("GB2312") to transcode characters)

- CSV files cannot be parsed correctly when there are special symbols, located in the readCsvFile function of utils.cpp, fixed (using an improved parsing method that relies on a simple state machine to track whether text segments are inside quotation marks and correctly handle line breaks within fields)
