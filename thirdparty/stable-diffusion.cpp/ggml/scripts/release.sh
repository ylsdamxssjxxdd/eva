# Automated release script for ggml.
#
# Note: Sync from llama.cpp should be done separately via PR process
# prior to running this script.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/release.sh prepare [major|minor|patch] [--dry-run]
#   ./scripts/release.sh finalize [--dry-run]
#
# Two-stage release process:
#
# Stage 1 - Prepare:
# $ ./scripts/release.sh prepare minor
# This creates a release candidate branch with version bump and removes -dev suffix.
# The branch should then be manually pushed and a PR created, reviewed, and merged.
#
# Stage 2 - Finalize:
# $ ./scripts/release.sh finalize
# After the RC PR is merged, this reads the current version from CMakeLists.txt,
# creates the release tag, and prepares the next development cycle.
#
# Prepare stage:
# 1. Creates release candidate branch
# 2. Updates version and removes -dev suffix
# 3. Commits the version bump
#
# Finalize stage:
# 1. Reads current release version from CMakeLists.txt
# 2. Creates signed git tag on master
# 3. Adds -dev suffix back for next development cycle
# 4. Creates branch and commit for development version
#
