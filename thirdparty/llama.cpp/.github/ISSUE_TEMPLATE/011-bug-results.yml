        Thanks for taking the time to fill out this bug report!
        This issue template is intended for bug reports where the model evaluation results
        (i.e. the generated text) are incorrect or llama.cpp crashes during model evaluation.
        If you encountered the issue while using an external UI (e.g. ollama),
        please reproduce your issue using one of the examples/binaries in this repository.
        The `llama-cli` binary can be used for simple and reproducible model inference.
